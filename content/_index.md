Hey, I'm Frank (He/Him/They). Welcome to my site. Sometimes I post things longer than 240 characters, which I'm told counts as a blog. Such things are here and are likely to include cybersecurity, risk, games, or just anything else I get the itch to post. If you want to know more about the guy behind the keyboard, check out [About](/about/).  

If you have questions, comments, or just need to get a hold of me, [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/beermetalpc.bsky.social) (public) or [Email (PGP available)](mailto:contact@BeerMetalPC.com) are the most reliable options.
